## One_Stop
This React/Redux application allows users to search for news articles, keep track of todo tasks, write notes, and send emails, all from one website. This eliminates the need to use multiple apps or websites to complete everyday tasks. Every portion of this app was designed with a wide variety of users in mind -- whether mobile or using a large screen, all features display in a functional and aesthetically pleasing way.

### News

This feature allows the user to search via keyword for relevant news articles. Search results include an image, title, news source, and description. This is a great place to peruse articles and maintain awareness about the issues of the day. Because each article appears in a Bootstrap-react card, the content is completely responsive (see below).

### Todos

This feature allows the user to make a list of tasks to complete, move tasks to a "completed" list, delete them, or move them from the "completed" list to the original list. Todos also allows a user to note details for each task, which are stored in local storage along with all list items. The design of this feature includes fun emojis and sleek lines.

### Notes

The notes feature allows the user to take notes, save them to local storage, and export them as a txt file. The "dashboard" design of this feature allows the user to move note cards around on a larger screen. On smaller screens, note cards appear in column format.

### Email

This feature allows the user to send emails via EmailJS. This helps the user avoid having to move between different apps to achieve different goals.

## Minimum Viable Product

The MVP for this project was to include the Todos, Notes, and News features. Adding additional features to Todos and News was an additional achievement, as was storing data in local storage through Redux.

### Future Goals

To make this app truly useful for the busy professional, I would like to store user data in a database. This way, the he/she will be able to log in on any device and have access to content.
